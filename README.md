Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to the development and maintenance of high-quality software systems. It involves the design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance of software products.
Software engineering plays a crucial role in the technology industry by enabling the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
the development of programming languages such as Fortran and C, the establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, the advent of structured programming in the 1970s, and the rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements -- Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
Design -- Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation -- Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
Testing -- Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment -- Releasing the software to users or customers.
Maintenance -- Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
waterfall methodology is sequential and it for distinct phases like a waterfall while the agile methodology has an iterave and incremental approach which is flexible and adaptable to change.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer -- Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer -- Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager -- Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs -- Software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code eg visual studio, eclipse 
VCS -- Software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members eg Git, Subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Technical debt -- regular reassessment of goals
Changing requirements -- effective communication between client and software developers
Tight deadlines -- prioritisation of goals and objectives

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
unit testing -- testing individual components of software
integration testing -- testing the interaction between different subsystems
system testing -- testing the entire software as a whole
acceptance testing -- testing software againsst user requirements to make sure it meets user needs
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the ability to ask AI concise, clear questions in order to get answers tailor made for what you are looking for.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
